Alas, this version does not deliver the features I promised in an earlier post. Other issues were simply deemed more urgent at this time. The NEWS file gives a bullet-point summary of changes. This post is an attempt to give an overview of a conceptual issue that necessitated the biggest change in the package. Due to this change, some old results generated with frscored_cna() and frscore() may not be reproducible with the new default behaviors, hence this post.</description></item><item><title>Visualizing frscore results, part 1</title><link>/blog/frscore_viz1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/frscore_viz1/</guid><description>This post is the first in a series of short texts about the frscore package, in which I describe upcoming changes in the package itself, and try to give some tips about how to make working with the package more convenient. This post and the next one are about visualizing the output of frscore() and frscored_cna().
Discussing with users of cna, I get the impression that the method is fairly often used specifically to discover or generate hypotheses about interactions between known causes of some outcome of interest.</description></item></channel></rss>
