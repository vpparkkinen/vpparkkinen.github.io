This post and the next one are about visualizing the output of frscore() and frscored_cna().
Discussing with users of cna, I get the impression that the method is fairly often used specifically to discover or generate hypotheses about interactions between known causes of some outcome of interest.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>I am a philosopher of science working mostly on problems related to theory of explanation, and epistemology of causation. That is, I seek answers to the following kinds of questions: What is it that makes a piece of information explanatory of some event or state of affairs? How does explanation differ from other epistemic outputs of science such as prediction or &amp;ldquo;mere&amp;rdquo; truthful description of the world? How can we reliably learn about what causes what?</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/</guid><description>Books Parkkinen, V-P., Wallmann, C., Wilde, M., Clarke, B., Illari, P., Kelly, MP., Norell, C., Russo, F., Shaw, B., &amp;amp; Williamson, J.
